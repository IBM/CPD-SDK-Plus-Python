# CPD SDK Plus

This package is a collection of frequently used utility functions for data science related services on Cloud Pak for Data, covering:
- Storage volume (SV)
- Watson Studio (WS)
- Watson Machine Learning (WML)
- Watson Machine Learning Accelerator (WMLA)
- Watson OpenScale (WOS)

Some methods are higher level wrappers based on existing methods from the official SDK packages (e.g., to list all data assets in a WML deployment space), while the others are a python wrapper based on API methods (e.g., for storage volume service).

## Install
Before this package is released to PyPI, you can install it using the distribution:
```
pip install cpd_sdk_plus-1.1.tar.gz
```

## Use
There are example notebooks that show how to use some of the methods. A complete documentation will be released in the near future.
